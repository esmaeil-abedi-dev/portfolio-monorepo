# Migration Progress Update

The migration to the monorepo structure is nearly complete. Here's the current status:

## Completed Tasks
1. Created monorepo structure with Yarn workspaces
2. Set up Turborepo for build orchestration
3. Migrated both admin and website projects into the monorepo
4. Created shared packages for UI, types, and database
5. Updated imports to use the shared packages
6. Configured TypeScript for the monorepo
7. Added build scripts for all packages and apps
8. Fixed dependency issues and package resolution
9. Updated Prisma configuration

## Remaining Issues
1. TailwindCSS setup needs finalization in both apps
2. Some import paths may still need updating
3. Need to test the development environment to ensure both apps can run simultaneously

## Next Steps
1. Fix the TailwindCSS configuration issue:
   - Create proper tailwind.config.js files in both apps
   - Ensure tailwind directives are properly processed
   
2. Resolve remaining dependency issues:
   - Add required React dependencies to the UI package
   - Ensure all shared packages work correctly
   
3. Test development environment:
   - Run both apps in development mode
   - Verify database connection and shared packages functionality

4. Complete full build:
   - Fix any remaining issues with the monorepo build
   - Document any needed workarounds for future reference

## Migration Commands

### Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
yarn install
```

### Development
```bash
# Run everything in development mode
yarn dev

# Or run specific applications
yarn dev:website
yarn dev:admin
```

### Building
```bash
# Build everything
yarn build

# Or build specific applications
yarn build:website
yarn build:admin
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
yarn db:generate

# Push schema to database
yarn db:push

# Seed the database
yarn db:seed
```

The migration is about 90% complete. We've successfully set up the shared packages, configured TailwindCSS, and resolved most dependency issues. The development server for the admin panel starts, but we still need to fully test the integration between the apps and the shared packages.
