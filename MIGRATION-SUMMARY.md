# Monorepo Migration Summary

## What's Been Accomplished

1. **Created Monorepo Structure**
   - Set up Yarn workspaces
   - Configured Turborepo for build orchestration
   - Created the apps/packages directory structure

2. **Migrated Existing Projects**
   - Moved admin project to apps/admin
   - Moved website project to apps/website 
   - Preserved all functionality and files

3. **Created Shared Packages**
   - `@esmaeilabedi/types`: Shared TypeScript types
   - `@esmaeilabedi/ui`: Reusable UI components
   - `@esmaeilabedi/database`: Prisma schema and DB client

4. **Updated Import Paths**
   - Refactored imports to use shared packages
   - Updated content types to use shared type definitions

5. **Fixed Dependencies**
   - Installed required dependencies in all packages
   - Resolved version conflicts and peer dependencies
   - Set up TailwindCSS in both apps

6. **Added Build Configuration**
   - Created build scripts in package.json
   - Set up proper Turborepo pipeline
   - Added postcss and TailwindCSS configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Test Development Environment**
   - Ensure both apps can run simultaneously
   - Verify correct loading of shared packages

2. **Complete Integration**
   - Update any remaining import paths
   - Ensure consistent styling across apps

3. **Deploy**
   - Set up Vercel project for the monorepo
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy both apps from the monorepo

4. **Documentation**
   - Complete README with setup instructions
   - Document the monorepo structure and conventions

The migration has successfully established the foundation for a well-organized monorepo with shared code across the admin panel and public website. This structure will make future development more efficient and consistent.
